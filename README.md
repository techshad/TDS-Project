# GitHub Zurich User Scrape

**Scraping Process**: Data was scraped using the GitHub API to extract users in Zurich with over 50 followers and their repository information. Requests were made in batches using pagination, and data was filtered to exclude any invalid or incomplete entries.
  
**Interesting Finding**: We observed that certain Zurich-based developers had repositories with highly starred projects but minimal following. This indicates that some developers have strong projects that are still undiscovered.

**Actionable Insight**: Developers should focus more on marketing their high-quality repositories to increase visibility, as strong code alone does not guarantee followers or recognition.
